# HV23.05 Aurora

## Description

The Northern Lights appeared at exceptionally low latitudes this year due to the high level of solar activity. But from Santa's grotto at the North Pole, it's not unusual at all to see them stretching across the sky. Snowball the elf tried to capture a video of the aurora for his Instagram feed, but his phone doesn't work well in poor light, and the results were rather grainy and disappointing. Is there anything you can do to obtain a clearer image?

## Solution

Well, well, well, this turned out to be quite the personal journey for me. It all started with a Google search on enhancing videos of the night sky. Soon enough, I stumbled upon various methods and tools designed to elevate the quality of astrophotography. Motivated, I decided to extract all frames as PNG from the MP4 video. Fortunately, the internet is flooded with a plethora of tools for this task, and I quickly found one that suited my needs.

To stack those frames, I opted for a tool called [Siril](https://siril.org/), and luckily, it was available for Linux. After installation, I loaded all the frames into Siril and hit the stacking button. Voila! It worked like a charm, and the resulting image revealed the flag.
