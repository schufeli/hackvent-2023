# HackVent 2023 CTF - Writeups

Like last year, I decided to play in the HackVent CTF, but this time I wanted to do some write-ups, and now we are here. Sadly, I hadn't had as much time as last year and couldn't solve as many challenges as I would have liked to. But none the less, it was an absolute blast.
